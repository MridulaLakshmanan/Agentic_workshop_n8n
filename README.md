# 🤖 Agentic AI Workflow Automation using n8n

An end-to-end collection of **Agentic AI workflows built using n8n**, demonstrating how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be orchestrated to perform real-world automation tasks such as **resume screening, accounting analysis, and RAG-based chatbots**.

This project focuses on **agent-based reasoning**, **workflow orchestration**, and **secure AI automation**, going beyond simple prompt-based AI demos.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Agent-based AI workflows using n8n
- Integration with OpenAI and Groq LLMs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Resume screening capstone project
- Structured outputs (JSON / Excel)
- Security-first design (credentials excluded)

## 🚀 Workflows Included

### 🔹 Basic OpenAI Agent
- Demonstrates a simple LLM-powered agent
- Handles prompt → reasoning → response flow

### 🔹 Basic Groq Agent
- Uses Groq LLM for fast inference
- Shows multi-provider flexibility

### 🔹 Accounting Agent
- AI assistant for accounting-related analysis
- Applies reasoning to domain-specific inputs

### 🔹 RAG Chatbot
- Implements retrieval-augmented generation
- Produces context-grounded responses

### 🔹 Agentic RAG Workflow
- Advanced RAG with agent-style decision logic
- Separates retrieval and reasoning steps

### 🔹 Capstone: Resume Screening Agent
- End-to-end resume evaluation system
- Generates structured screening results
- Sample output included (`result_file.xlsx`)

## 🔄 How This Project Works (Workflow Explanation)

1. **Trigger**
   - Workflow starts via manual trigger or webhook

2. **Input Processing**
   - User input, documents, or data are received
   - Inputs are cleaned and structured inside n8n

3. **LLM Agent Execution**
   - An AI agent (OpenAI or Groq) processes the input
   - Agent performs reasoning and decides next actions

4. **Optional RAG Pipeline**
   - Relevant documents or context are retrieved
   - Retrieved data is injected into the LLM prompt

5. **Business Logic Handling**
   - Resume evaluation, accounting reasoning, or chatbot logic
   - Decisions are made based on agent output

6. **Output Generation**
   - Results are generated as text, JSON, or Excel files
   - Outputs can be stored, displayed, or forwarded

7. **End of Workflow**
   - Workflow completes with structured, actionable results

📌 This workflow-driven approach enables **scalable, reusable, and explainable AI automation**.
